'Bilbo Baggins lives a quiet, peaceful life in his comfortable hole at Bag End',
'Bilbo lives in a hole because he is a hobbit—one of a race of small plump people about half the size of humans with furry toes and a great love of good food and drink',
'Bilbo is quite content at Bag End, near the bustling hobbit village of Hobbiton but one day his comfort is shattered by the arrival of the old wizard Gandalf, who persuades Bilbo to set out on an adventure with a group of thirteen militant dwarves',
'The dwarves are embarking on a great quest to reclaim their treasure from the marauding dragon Smaug and Bilbo is to act as their burglar', 
'The dwarves are very skeptical about Gandalf’s choice for a burglar, and Bilbo is terrified to leave his comfortable life to seek adventure',
'But Gandalf assures both Bilbo and the dwarves that there is more to the little hobbit than meets the eye']
